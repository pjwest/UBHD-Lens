						<title>Allocation of EU expenditure for 2012 by Member State</title>
						<p>Allocating expenditure to Member States is merely an accounting exercise
							that gives a very limited view of the benefits that each Member State
							derives from the Union. The Commission continues to stress this point at
							every opportunity. 
							<fn>
								<label>(1)</label>
								<p>A full statement on this policy and its rationale was made in
									Chapter 2 of the 1998 Commission report ‘Financing of the
									European Union’ and in ‘Budget contributions, EU expenditure,
									budgetary balances and relative prosperity of the Member
									States’, a paper presented by the Commission to the Economic and
									Financial Affairs Council of 13 October 1997. The Presidency
									conclusions of the Berlin European Council of 24 and 25 March
									1999 endorse this principle: ‘[...] it is recognised that the
									full benefits of Union membership cannot be measured solely in
									budgetary terms’ (point 68 of the Presidency conclusions).</p>
							</fn>
							This accounting allocation, among other drawbacks, is
							non-exhaustive and gives no indication of many of the other benefits
							gained from EU policies such as those relating to the internal market
							and economic integration, not to mention political stability and
							security.</p>
						<p>In 2012, a total amount of EUR 126 349.3 million (i.e. 91.11 % of the
							total implemented EU expenditure, including EFTA contributions and
							earmarked revenue) was allocated to Member States. See notes in annexed
							tables for further details on the methodology used for the allocation of
							expenditure.</p>

							<title>Methodological note: allocation of expenditure</title>
							<p>In 2012, total executed EU expenditure amounted to EUR 135 851.6
								million (excluding EUR 2 831.9 million of expenditure made up of
								earmarked revenue and including EUR 249.6 million of expenditure
								made up of EFTA contributions), or EUR 138 683.4 million when
								including earmarked revenue and that from EFTA, of which EUR 126
								349.3 million (i.e. 91.1 %) was allocated to Member States and EUR 6
								239.2 million to non-member countries.</p>
							<p>Further to this, an amount of EUR 3 263.1 million was allocated to
								various states, in case of which the country of the final
								beneficiary cannot be unequivocally determined.</p>

								<title>Year of reference</title>
								<p>Executed and allocated expenditure are actual payments made
									during a financial year, pursuant to that year’s appropriations
									or to carry-overs of non-utilised appropriations from the
									previous year. Expenditure financed from earmarked revenue is
									presented separately.</p>
							</sec>
							<sec>
								<title>Allocation of expenditure</title>
								<p>Based on the criteria used for the UK correction, i.e. all
									possible expenditure must be allocated, except for external
									actions, pre-accession strategy (if paid to the EU-15),
									guarantees, reserves and expenditure under earmarked
									revenue.</p>
							</sec>
							<sec>
								<title>Allocation by Member State</title>
								<p>Expenditure is allocated to the country in which the principal
									recipient resides, on the basis of the information available in
									the Commission’s accounting financial system (ABAC). Some
									expenditure is not (or is improperly) allocated in ABAC due to
									conceptual difficulties. In this case, whenever obtained from
									the corresponding services, additional information is used (e.g.
									for Galileo, research and administration).</p>

							the trans-European networks (TENs), Galileo/EGNOS, Marco Polo II and the

							<title>The seventh framework programme for research and technological
								development (FP7)</title>
							<p>FP7 covers the TFEU and the European Atomic Energy Community
								(Euratom) and lasts from 2007 until 2013. The programme’s budget of
								EUR 55.5 billion represents a substantial increase compared with the
								sixth framework programme (41 % at 2004 prices), confirming research
								as a high priority in Europe.</p>
							<p>This money is (for the most part) being spent on grants to research
								actors all over Europe and beyond, in order to co-finance research,
								technological development and demonstration projects. Grants are
								determined on the basis of calls for proposals and a peer review
								process, which are highly competitive.</p>
							<p>In order to complement national research programmes, activities
								funded from FP7 must have a ‘European added value’. One key aspect
								of the European added value is the transnationality of many actions:
								projects are carried out by consortia which include participants
								from different European (and other) countries; fellowships require
								mobility over national borders. Indeed, many research challenges are
								so complex that they can only be addressed at European level. But
								there is also a new action for ‘individual teams’ with no obligation
								for transnational cooperation. In this case, the ‘European added
								value’ lies in raising the competition between scientists in
								fundamental ‘frontier’ research from the national to the European
								level.</p>
							<p>FP7 is both larger and more comprehensive than its predecessors. It
								is also more flexible, with simplified procedures.</p>

								<title>Developments in 2012</title>
								<p>In 2012, 53 calls for proposals were concluded within FP7. A
									total of 17 374 eligible proposals were peer reviewed, out of
									which 3 089 were retained for funding, resulting in a success
									rate of 17.78 % on a proposal basis.</p>
								<p>A total of 70 059 applicants took part in all eligible proposals,
									for a total requested EU contribution of EUR 30.78 billion, of
									which 14 821 applicants were retained for funding, for a total
									requested EU contribution of EUR 4.98 billion. The overall
									success rate was 21.16 % in terms of applicants. It is very
									close to the overall success rate of FP7 implementation during
									2007–12 (22 %).</p>
								<p>Good results have been obtained as regards the mandatory target
									that 15 % of the cooperation programme budget (with more than 50
									% of planned resources the largest programme under FP7) should
									go to SMEs. In 2012, 16.4 % of this budget went to SMEs.</p>
								<p>A total of EUR 7 853 million was spent on FP7 in 2012.</p>
